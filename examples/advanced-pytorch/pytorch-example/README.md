### Install dependencies and project

Install the dependencies defined in `pyproject.toml` as well as the `pytorch_example` package.

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Run the project

You can run your Flower project in both _simulation_ and _deployment_ mode without making changes to the code. If you are starting with Flower, we recommend you using the _simulation_ mode as it requires fewer components to be launched manually. By default, `flwr run` will make use of the Simulation Engine.

### Run with the Simulation Engine

```bash
flwr run .
```

You can also override some of the settings for your `ClientApp` and `ServerApp` defined in `pyproject.toml`. For example:

```bash
flwr run . --run-config "num-server-rounds=5 learning-rate=0.05"
```

### Run with the Deployment Engine

> \[!NOTE\]
> An update to this example will show how to run this Flower application with the Deployment Engine and TLS certificates, or with Docker.
